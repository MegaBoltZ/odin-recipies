    <p>
      These whole wheat pancakes come out very light and fluffy. My kids love
      them! If you like blueberries, throw a few on top before cooking the
      second side.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 ¼ cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons oil together in a separate
        bowl until well combined. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and
        stir until just combined; batter may seem a bit thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-low
        heat for 5 minutes. Working in batches, pour 1/3 cup of batter for each
        pancake into the hot skillet. Spread batter into circles with a spoon;
        cook until browned on the bottom and bubbles appear on top, 1 1/2 to 2
        minutes. Flip and cook until set in the middle and browned on the other
        side, about 2 more minutes.
